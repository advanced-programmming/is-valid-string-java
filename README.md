# is-valid-string-java
Input - a string of alphabet chars (like "aabbccddd", etc)  Function should calculate if it is valid. Definition of valid string:  - Condition 1. if all characters in string appears same number of times OR - Condition 2. It will also be valid if after removal of 1 char from a string remaining characters will occur same number of times   In the above example "aabbccddd" Number of "a"s -2 Number of "b"s - 2 Number of "c"s - 2 Number of "d"s - 3 String is valid because we can remove just one "d" and remaining characters a,b,c,d will occur same number of times - 2   Tasks:  1) Create a method that will implement boolean isValid(String) 2) Write program that will test method with different tests
